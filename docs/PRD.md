## üßÆ Scoring Logic

Each **league** defines its own `scoringRules`.
When an admin adds a scoring event, the app automatically:

1. Looks up the points for the event type.
2. Updates:

   * Player total + weekly points.
   * Team total + weekly points (if player is drafted).
3. Aggregates leaderboards in real-time.

## üß© API Specification (REST)

All endpoints prefixed with `/api`.

## üß† Core Logic Summary

### Draft Flow

* League Admin starts draft ‚Üí order randomized if enabled.
* Teams pick players in snake order.
* When a player is drafted:

  * Mark `player.draftedBy = team_id`.
  * Add player to team‚Äôs `players` list.

### Scoring Flow

* Admin enters scoring events weekly.
* Each event updates player and team totals.
* Weekly scores can be finalized to lock results.

### Invite Flow

* Admin creates invite code (league or team).
* User redeems code:

  * League invite ‚Üí joins league, creates team.
  * Team invite ‚Üí joins specific team.
* Invite usage tracked to prevent overuse.

## üîÑ Reuse for Other Shows

To adapt for another show (e.g., *Big Brother*):

1. Create new League:

   ```bash
   POST /api/leagues
   {
     "leagueName": "Big Brother 27 Fantasy",
     "settings": {
       "show": "Big Brother",
       "seasonLabel": "BB27",
       "maxTeams": 10,
       "membersPerTeam": 2,
       "scoringRules": {
         "HOH_WIN": 5,
         "VETO_WIN": 4,
         "NOMINATED": -2,
         "SAVED_FROM_NOMINATION": 3,
         "EVICTED": -3,
         "WINS_SEASON": 10
       }
     }
   }
   ```
2. Import houseguest list using `/players/import`.
3. Draft and score using the same UI and endpoints.
